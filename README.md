# morphological-information-datasets
This collection of files contain datasets for 6 languages (Russian, Basque, Turkish, Spanish, Czech and English) that include morphological labels of different complexity. These files are ready to use and are suitable for training with such systems as IXA pipes, Morpheus, Flair, as well as transfomer-based models. Apart from that, it also includes the scripts for the training of transformer-based models we used in our experiments (mBERT, XLM-RoBERTa and language-specific models) and the further out-of-domain evaluation of such models.

## File source
The source of our files are the CoNLL-U format files presented in the [SIGMORPHON 2019 Shared task](https://sigmorphon.github.io/sharedtasks/2019/task2/). They contain annotated phrases, where each word is annotated with all corresponding morphological information. During the preprocessing we extract only the wordforms, corresponding lemmas and morphological information necessary to form each label. 

## Label structure
In order to create the labels, we address the [Unimorph schema](https://unimorph.github.io/doc/unimorph-schema.pdf). We form labels of different morphological complexity: \
**UPOS** label: includes only wordÂ´s postag; \
**UPOS+Case+Gender**: includes postag, case and gender information of the word \
**UPOS+Case+Number**: includes postag, case and number information of the word \
**UPOS+Case+Gender+Number**:  includes postag, case and number information of the word \
**UPOS+AllFeaturesOrdered**: includes all the morphological information of the word in the following order: postag, case, gender, number, rest of the features \
**UPOS+AllFeaturesNotOrdered**: includes all the morphological information in the way it is presented in the original file 

## File format
The files with morphological labels have the following format: \
word \t label \t lemma \
The files that contain the shortes edir scripts (SES) to train transformer-based models are presented in the format: \
word \t SES \
Each new phrase is divided by an empty line, mantaining the CoNLL-U file format \
There are files for training and further evaluation out-of-domain. As we also performed the training in the reversed setting, we provide train, dev and test files for both corpora for each presented language (except Basque, as there is only one available corpus in the CoNLL-U file format) \
*-all-labels.txt files contain only one column with all the possible SES labels for transformer models' training, depending on the in-domain and out-of-domain corpora, which is specified in the file name itself.
