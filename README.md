# morphological-information-datasets
This collection of files contain datasets for 6 languages (Russian, Basque, Turkish, Spanish, Czech and English) that include morphological labels of different complexity. These files are ready to use and are suitable for training with such systems as IXA pipes, Morpheus, Flair and transfomer-based models.

## File source
The source of our files are the CoNLL-U format files presented in the SIGMORPHON 2019 Shared task \ref. They contain annotated phrases, where each word is annotated with all corresponding morphological information. During the preprocessing we extract only the wordforms, corresponding lemmas and morphological information necessary to form the certain label. 

## Label structure
In order to create the labels, we address the Unimorph schema \ref. We form labels of different morphological complexity:
**UPOS** label: includes only wordÂ´s postag;
**UPOS+Case+Gender**:
**UPOS+Case+Number**:
**UPOS+Case+Gender+Number**:
**UPOS+AllFeat.ordered**:

## File format
The files have the following format:
word \t label \t lemma

Each new phrase is divided by an empty line, mantaining the CoNLL-U file format.
